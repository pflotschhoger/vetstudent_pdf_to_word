# vetstudent_pdf_to_word

My girlfriend is a vet student. Her preferred way of learning is to create summaries of her lecture pdfs, replace terrms and format the resulting word document. As this often takes so much time out of her day that she can do hardly anything else, i created an excel macro that does a large amount of this task for her. Why excel? because most computers have it, and it works all right with word. 

If you find this project useful, i would be nice if you could support me with about $10.
